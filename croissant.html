    <p>
      The origin of croissant, the <span>Kipferl</span>, can be dated back to at
      least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes.The
      <span>Kipferl</span>
      can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the
      rugelach a form of <span>Kipferl</span> ). The birth of the croissant
      itself‚Äîthat is, its adaptation from the plainer form of
      <span>Kipferl</span>, before the invention of viennoiseries‚Äîcan be dated
      to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer,
      August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery (
      <span>"Boulangerie Viennoise"</span>) at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.
      This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the
      <span>Kipferl</span>
      and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators
      (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term
      for supposedly Vienna-style pastries).

    <p>
      The French version of the
      <span>Kipferl</span> was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has
      become a universally identifiable shape across the world. Sylvain Claudius
      Goy, a French chef, was the first to make croissant with yeast leavened
      laminated dough. Alan Davidson, editor of the Oxford Companion to Food,
      found no printed recipe for the present-day croissant in any French recipe
      book before the early 20th century; the earliest French reference to a
      croissant he found was among the "fantasy or luxury breads" in Payen's Des
      substances alimentaires, 1853. However, early recipes for non-laminated
      croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to
      croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850. Zang
      himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the
      bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in
      several works of the time: "This same M. Zank founded around 1830, in
      Paris, the famous <span>Boulangerie Viennoise </span>" . Several sources
      praise this bakery's products: "Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in
      particular, the succulent products of the
      <span>Boulangerie Viennoise</span> "; "which seemed to us as fine as if it
      came from the Viennes bakery on the rue de Richelieu". By 1869, the
      croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast
      staple, and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical All the Year
      Round) of "the workman's pain de m√©nage and the soldier's pain de
      munition, to the dainty croissant on the boudoir table". The puff pastry
      technique that now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in
      the late 17th century, when La Varenne's Le Cuisinier fran√ßois gave a
      recipe for it in the 1680 - and possibly earlier - edition. It was
      typically used not on its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as
      in a vol-au-vent). It does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the
      croissant until the 20th century.
